# The identification of c in the assignation marked with XXX works.
  In some Algol 68 systems the assignation may fail or result in UB,
  because the storage of the REF REAL c doesn't exist yet.  In GNU
  Algol 68 this works and the value yielded by c is guaranteed to be
  zero.

BEGIN REAL b;
      b := c; # XXX #
      ASSERT (b = 0);
      REAL c;
      c := b
END
