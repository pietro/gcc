The tests in compile/mcts and execute/mcts have been adapted from:

  The Revised MC Algol 68 Test Set, version 3

edited by Dick Gr√ºne in 1973 and originally published by the
Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, a non-profit institution founded in
1946 aiming at the promotion of pure mathematics and its applications.

The WG 2.1 blessed the test set with this authorized statement:

  "This ALGOL68 Test Set has been reviewed by the IFIP Working Group
   2.1, which considers it as a valuable means of testing
   implementations of ALGOL68."

The test set explores all odd corners of Algol 68.

The tests have been modified in order to accommodate the GNU Algol 68
implementation.  Some general adaptations are:

- Many tests in the original MC test set print out expected results so
  they can be verified visually.  We check for them programmatically
  instead making use of the ASSERT construct.

Additional particular modifications are explained and justified in the
source files of the corresponding tests.

The tests fall in the following categories:

Null programs (nullNN.a68)
  Various forms of empty enclosed-clauses.

Simple tests (simpNN.a68)
  Contains almost all language features of the language used in
  simple ways.

Declarers tests (declNN.a68)
  Declarers and their well-formedness.
