/* A MOID_T represents a mode indicator.

   NUMBER is an unique number assigned to the moid when it gets created.  A
   renumber_moids function exists in a68-parser-modes.cc but it dosn't seem to
   be used at all.

   ATTRIBUTE characterizes the kind of mode and is one of the values defined in
   a68-parser-attrs.def.  Valid values are:

     PROC_SYMBOL for procecure modes.
     ROWS_SYMBOL for row modes.
     REF_SYMBOL for reference modes.
     FLEX_SYMBOL for flexible reference modes.
     STRUCT_SYMBOL for struct modes.
     UNION_SYMBOL for union modes.
     IN_TYPE_MODE for XXX modes.
     OUT_TYPE_MODE for XXX modes.
     SERIES_MODE for XXX modes.
     INDICANT for XXX modes.
     STANDARD for standard modes.

   NODE is a parse tree node XXX.

   HAS_ROWS is true if the mode contains rows somewhere in its internal
   structure.

   The interpretation of SUB depends on the kind of mode:
   - For REF modes it is the referred mode.
   - For FLEX modes it is the referred mode.
   - For ROW modes it is the mode of the elements.
   - For PROC modes it is the mode of the value yielded by the procedure.

   The interpretation of DIM depends on the kind of mode:
   - In VOID_SYMBOL, STANDARD or INDICANT mode, if DIM is positive it
     specifies the size of the longsety of the mode.  If DIM is negative then
     abs (DIM) is the size of hte shortsety of the mode.
   - In ROW modes, DIM is the number of dimensions.
   - In STRUCT modes, DIM is the number of fields.
   - In UNION modes, DIM is the number of united modes.
   - In PROC_SYMBOL modes, DIM is the number of arguments.
   - In SERIES_MODE and STOWED_MODE modes, DIM is the number modes.

   SLICE is the mode resulting from slicing a value of this mode.  For example,
   slicing a M_ROW_INT yields a M_INT.

   EQUIVALENT_MODE (referred as EQUIVALENT), for INDICANTs it is its declarer
   mode (in MODE FOO = BAR FOO is the indicant and BAR is its declarer) and for
   STANDARD modes it may be a mode that reflects its structure.

   USE is used by the is_well_formed function, which detects whether a mode is
   well formed, i.e. that the mode doesn't refer to itself nor it relates to
   void.

   DEFLEXED_MODE is like the current mode, but without FLEX.  Only defined for
   modes that have a SUB, i.e. REF, FLEX, ROW and PROC.  In other modes this is
   NO_MODE.

   For refs to structs, rows or flex, NAME points to the corresponding name
   mode.  For example, for a mode REF STRUCT (INT i, REAL x), NAME points to a
   mode STRUCT (REF INT i, REF REAL x).  This is used for selections.

   For rows of structs, rows or flex, MULTIPLE points to the corresponding row
   mode.  For example, for a mode [] STRUCT (INT i, REAL x), MULTIPLE points to
   a mode STRUCT ([]INT i, []REAL x).  This is used for selections.

   PACK is a pack of moids.  For a STOWED_MODE, it contains the modes of the
   arguments of a procedure, or the modes of the units in a collateral clause.
   For a SERIES_MODE, it contains the modes of the completing units in a serial
   clause, the alternatives in a conformity clause, the alternatives in a
   CONDITIONAL_CLAUSE, the alternatives in a CASE_CLAUSE,

   CTYPE is a GCC GENERIC tree corresponding to this mode.  It is computed and
   installed by a68_lower_moid.  */

/* The access class static property of a stored value determines how the value
   can be reached at run-time.  It is used by the lowering pass in order to
   minimize copies at run-time.

   CONSTANT is for constant literals.  At run-time these literals will either
   reside in operand instructions or in space allocated in CONSTAB%.

   DIRIDEN (direct identifier) means that the value is stored on IDST% at some
   static address.  This is the access class used for values ascribed to
   identifiers as long as the block in hich they are declared has not been
   left.  It is also used for values resulting from actions such as the
   selection from a value possessed by an identifier or the dereferencing fo a
   name corespodning to a variable.

   VARIDEN (variable identifier) is used for values which are names/variables.
   The name is stored on IDST%.  The static elaboration of the dereferencing of
   a variable with access VARIDEN results in a value with access DIRIDEN, not
   requiring any run-time action.  Same happens with selections of variables of
   access VARIDEN.

   INDIDEN (indirect identifier) is used for values that are stored in a memory
   location in IDST%.  The static elaboration of a dereferencing applied to a
   value of access DIRIDEN.

   DIRWOST (direct working stack) is very much like DIRIDEN, except that the
   value is stored in WOST% rathern than in IDST%.  This access is used for the
   result of an action when this result does not preexist in memory and hence
   has to be constructed in WOST%.

   INDWOST (indirect working stack) is very similar to INDIDEN.  Such an access
   can be obtained for example through the static elaboration of the
   dereferencing of a name the access of which is DIRWOST.

   NIHIL is used to characterize the absence of value.  This is used in the
   static elaboration of a jump, a voiding and a call ith a void result.

   Note that in all these classes we assume as run-time the intermediate
   language level we are lowering to, i.e. GENERIC.  A DIRIDEN value, for
   example, can very well stored in a register depending on further compiler
   optimizations.  */

/* A NODE_T is a node in the A68 Syntax tree produced by the lexer-scanner and
   later expanded by the Mailloux parser.

   NUMBER identifies the node uniquely in the syntax tree.

   ATTRIBUTE is a code that specifies the kind of entity denoted by the node.
   Valid attributes are defined in the enumeration a68_attribute above in
   this file.  Examples of attributes are ELIF_PART, GOTO_SYMBOL or BOLD_TAG.

   ANNOTATION provides a way to annotate a node with a reference to another
   node attribute.  This is currently used by the mode checker to annotate
   indexer nodes as slicer or as trimmers.

   TYPE (accessed as MOID) is either NO_MOID if the entity denoted by the node
   doesn't have a mode, or a suitable MOID_T reflecting the mode of the entity.
   This attribute is calculated and set in all the nodes of the tree by the
   mode collection and checker pass implemented by make_moid_list.

   INFO contains additional attributes of the node.  See NODE_INFO_T below.

   NEXT, PREVIOUS and SUB are links to other tree nodes.  They are used to link
   the syntax tree structure from the top:

        TOP <-> N <-> N <-> ...
                |                      < is PREVIOUS
		N <-> N <-> ...        > is NEXT
                      |                | is SUB
                      N <-> ...

   SEQUENCE is a link to another tree node.  It is used by the tax collector
   (symbol table builder) in order to handle DO .. OD ranges.

   NEST is a link to another tree node, which is the NEST for the current node.
   It is set by the tax collector (symbol table builder) and it is used for
   diagnostics.

   PACK (accessed as NODE_PACK) is either NO_PACK or an instance of the PACK_T
   structure defined below.  It is used by the modes checker.

   STATUS is a mask of flags, used by several passes that handle nodes.  Valid status flags are:

   SYMBOL_TABLE (accessed as TABLE) is either NO_TABLE or a TABLE_T containing
   a symbol table introduced by the entity denoted by the tree node.  These
   nodes are the ones introducing ranges: BEGIN, DO, etc.

   NON_LOCAL is either NO_TABLE, if the environ established by the node is
   local, or a pointer to a TABLE_T identifying the non-local environment
   associated with the tree node.  It is set by the static scope checker.  See
   3.2.2 and 5.2.3.2.b in the report for its application in the handling of
   local generators in serial clauses.

   TAG (accessed as TAX) is either NO_TAG or a TAG_T used to bind identifier
   nodes, routine texts and other indicants to their corresponding entry in a
   symbol table.  This is set by the taxes collector.

   The following fields are static properties managed an used in the lowering
   pass.

   ORIGIN is a static property that describes the history of the entity denoted
   by the node.  This is only used in nodes denoting values.

   DYNAMIC_STACK_ALLOCS is a flag used in serial clause nodes.  It determines
   whether the elaboration of the phrases in the serial clause may involve
   dynamic stack allocation.  This is used by the lower pass, along with
   NON_LOCAL above, in order to properly manage the stack pointer while
   lowering these clauses.

   CDECL is a GCC GENERIC tree corresponding to a DECL_FIELD for FIELD
   nodes.  */

   Even if at the moment this is not used by GCC, this field and the
   correponding machinery is still here in case it is useful in the future.

   PRIORITY (accessed as PRIO) is used by operator tree nodes and specifies the

   bottom-up parser.

   SYMBOL (accessed indirectly as NSYMBOL) contains the symbol value, a string,
   corresponding to the tree node.  This is used by tree nodes representing
   tokens such as bold tags, keywords and identifiers.  The symbols are set by
   the parser-scanner.

   TYPE is the mode of the entry.

   NODE is the defining identifier associated to the declaration.

   SCOPE is the lexical depth of the tag.  Zero corresponds to the primal
   scope.  It is set by the static scope checker.

   SCOPE_ASSIGNED determines whether a SCOPE has been actually assigned to the
   tag.  It is set by the static scope checker.  The entities which get
   assigned scopes are identities of format texts and routine texts.

   PORTABLE determines whether the construction associated with the tag is
   Algol 68 or some extension.

   VARIABLE is set when the defining identifier in NODE is defined in a
   variable declaration, as opposed to an identity declaration.  This is set by
   extract_variables and is used by the lowering pass.

   HEAP is used for defining identifier in NODE is defined in a variable
   declaration.  It is HEAP_SYMBOL or LOC_SYMBOL.

   IS_RECURSIVE is set for mode indicants whose definition is recursive,
   i.e. they appear in actual declarers within its own definition.

   ASCRIBED_ROUTINE_TEXT is set when the defining identifier is ascribed a
   routine-text in an identity declaration.

   IN_PROC is set when the defining identifier has been set in a
   proc-identity-declaration or in a brief-op-declaration.

   YOUNGEST_ENVIRON is used when NODE is either a ROUTINE_TEXT or a
   FORMAT_TEXT, and contains the youngest (higher) lexical level of any object
   directly declared in the routine or format body.  This is filled in and used
   by the scope checker.

   TREE_DECL is the GENERIC declaration for the definition of this symbol.

   INPUT_LINE is used by the original ALGOL 68 Genie to read lines from the
   tty.  But in this parser it is used uninitialized (!) by the
   a68_phrase_to_text routine in the top-down parser.  XXX.

   NEW_NODES is a global counter that keeps the number of parse tree nodes
   created.  It is currently not used for anything, but still updated in
   a68_new_node.

   NEW_MODES is a global counter that keeps the number of moids created.  It is
   currently not used for anything, but still updated in a68_new_moid.

   NEW_POSTULATES is a global counter that keeps the number of postulates
   created by the front-end.  It is currently not used for anything, but still
   updated in a68_make_postulate.

   NEW_NODE_INFOS is a global counter that keeps the number of NODE_INFO_T
   structures created by the front-end.  It is currently not used for anything,
   but still updated in a68_new_node_info.

   NEW_GENIE_INFOS is a global counter that keeps the number of GINFO_T
   structures created by the front-end.  It is currently no tused for anything,
   but still updated in a68_new_genie_info.

   SYMBOL_TABLE_COUNT is a global counter used by the parser.  XXX move to
   parser global state when syntax tree finalisation is moved to a68_parser?

   MODE_COUNT is the number of modes registered in the global modes table. XXX
   which table.

   TOP_KEYWORD is the top of the list of keywords known to the font-end.

   MODE_CACHE XXX.

   A68_MODES (accessed as MODE) is a collection of particular pre-defined
   modes.  These modes are initialized by stand_moids.

   JOB (accessed as A68_JOB) is the instance of MODULE_T with the global data
   corresponding to the source file being compiled.

   OPTIONS is the set of options currently set for the front-end.

   TOP_POSTULATE and TOP_POSTULATE_LIST are lists of postulates maintained by
   the front-end.

   POSTULATES is a collection of postulates used by the moid pretty printer.

   TOP_SOID_LIST is used by the moid machinery.

   STANDENV XXX.

   TOP_TOKEN XXX.

   INCLUDE_PATHS is the list of paths where we search for files to include.
   Directories are added to the list at the option handling language hook.
   The list is searched in FIFO order.
